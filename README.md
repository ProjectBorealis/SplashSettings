# SplashSettings

Customize Unreal Engine splash on startup with a random splash image

## Usage

Add this to your plugins folder. It will search in `Content/Splash` for splash images (`EdSplash*` for editor, `Splash*` for game).
png, jpg and bmp are supported splash image types.

Note: Remember to add `Splash` to "Additional Non-Asset Directories To Copy" in Project Packaging Settings.
